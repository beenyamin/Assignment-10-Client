            .Handles side effects, like data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulations.
            .Runs after rendering and can be used for both componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate logic.

                    ==> 3.useContext <==

            .Facilitates the sharing of data and state between components.
            .Provides global access to context data across the application.

              .useLocation provides access to the current URL, often used for routing and dynamic content.

                      ==> 5.useNavigate <==
                      
              .useNavigate is for programmatic navigation, vital for interactive React apps.
